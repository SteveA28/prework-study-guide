# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In this project I learned some HTML basics and identified its elements. I was able to build a basic HTML structure for my first website. Once I completed the HTML module I moved on to learning the CSS properties and visually shaped my website. After that I started to learn about JavaScript such as variables, control flow and other components. Lastly I wrote and called a JavaScript function in my website. The modules helped me create and solve the problems I created in depth. I was able to construct my first website as well as do all the coding necessary and correctly for it to function. I have always been interested in coding as it has always caught my eye when I would see someone doing it I have also done some myself in the past and enjoyed it. This project has taught me a lot and im excited to learn even more in my future projects. 

## Installation

For this project I needed to install a few programs onto my computer such as git for windows terminal, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub.
